<strong>100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</strong>

This folder is dedicated to the code I write while going through the Udemy course Welcome to the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.  This is the first of many course and books that I will be working through during my journey to learn python and how it applies to cybersecurity and open source intelligence collection methods.  The exercises written are not of my own design, but from the developers of the course, but you may use them as a way to verify/check your solutions or as a study aid while working through them.  I may not have the exact solution as presented on the site, and I may add extra code to make it my own or add additional functionality.  This is mainly for fun and to help me learn.
