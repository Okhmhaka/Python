# This exercise is geared toward understanding errors in python and how to debug them
# First, I will write the incorrect code but comment it out so python doesn't try to read it.
# Second, I will correct the code but leave it executable to see the differences.

# Incorrect code:

# print("Day 1 - String Manipulation)
#   print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
# print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world"))
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Correct code:

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String concatenation is done wiht the '+' sign.")
print('e.g. print("Hello, " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
